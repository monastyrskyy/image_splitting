# Overview
This tool is a Python-based graphical application designed to help you divide large images into smaller, printable tiles. It allows you to specify custom canvas dimensions, tile sizes, overlap between tiles, DPI (dots per inch) for image quality, and maximum padding. The tool ensures that your image is scaled appropriately, maintaining its aspect ratio without stretching, and fits within the specified canvas dimensions with controlled padding.

This application is particularly useful for creating large posters, murals, or any large-format prints that need to be assembled from smaller, more manageable pieces.

# Features
- Customizable Canvas Dimensions: Define the width and height of the overall canvas in centimeters.
- Adjustable Tile Sizes: Specify the width and height of individual tiles in centimeters.
- Overlap Control: Set the overlap between adjacent tiles to aid in seamless assembly.
- DPI Settings: Choose the desired DPI to control the image resolution and print quality.
- Padding Management: Set the maximum allowable padding as a percentage of the canvas size to ensure the image is appropriately scaled and centered.
- Aspect Ratio Preservation: The image is scaled to fit the canvas without stretching, maintaining its original aspect ratio.
