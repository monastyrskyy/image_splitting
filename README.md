# Overview
This tool is a Python-based graphical application designed to **divide large images into smaller, printable tiles**. It allows the user to specify custom canvas dimensions, tile sizes, overlap between tiles, DPI (dots per inch) for image quality, and maximum padding. The tool ensures that the image maintains its aspect ratio and fits within the specified canvas dimensions with controlled padding.

This app is particularly beneficial for painters who need their reference image to be the exact same size as their canvas. Printing several small images is often cheaper than printing one large image.

# Features
- **Customizable Canvas Dimensions:** Define the width and height of the overall canvas in centimeters.
- **Adjustable Tile Sizes:** Specify the width and height of individual tiles in centimeters.
- **Overlap Control:** Set the overlap between adjacent tiles to aid in seamless assembly.
- **DPI Settings:** Choose the desired DPI to control the image resolution and print quality.
- **Padding Management:** Set the maximum allowable padding as a percentage of the canvas size to ensure the image is appropriately scaled and centered.
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation:** The image is scaled to fit the canvas without stretching, maintaining its original aspect ratio.
